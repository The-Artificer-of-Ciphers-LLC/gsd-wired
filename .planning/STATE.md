# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** GSD's full development lifecycle running on a beads graph engine so that orchestrator context stays lean and subagents pull only the context they need.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Graph Primitives

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Graph Primitives)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-21 -- Phase 2 Plan 01 complete (internal/graph package, 21 tests, all passing)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 15%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.30 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Binary Scaffold | 2 | 14 min | 7 min |
| 2. Graph Primitives | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 5 min, 9 min, 4 min
- Trend: improving

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 56 requirements at fine granularity
- [Roadmap]: Phases 9 and 10 can run in parallel (independent dependencies)
- [Roadmap]: bd CLI wrapping for v1, direct Go import is Phase 6/optimization path
- [01-01]: go-sdk v1.4.1 used as official MCP library — authoritative, Google co-maintained
- [01-01]: runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo() for version hash — works with go install, no ldflags required
- [01-01]: Injected io.Reader/io.Writer in hook.Dispatch() — testable without os pipe mocking
- [01-01]: Pre-logger slog default in main() before Execute() — prevents stdout pollution
- [01-02]: No minAppVersion in plugin.json — per D-12, no minimum Claude Code version pinned
- [01-02]: StdoutPipe + bufio.Scanner in goroutine over bytes.Buffer — race-free subprocess stdout reading pattern
- [01-02]: .gitignore must use /gsdw (root-anchored) not gsdw — unanchored pattern matches cmd/gsdw directory
- [02-01]: NewClientWithPath() added as test injection point — bypasses LookPath for unit tests without live bd
- [02-01]: fake_bd uses FAKE_BD_CAPTURE_FILE env to write received args for exact arg verification in tests
- [02-01]: ListBlocked/QueryByLabel pass --limit 0 per research recommendation to prevent silent truncation
- [02-01]: ClosePlan post-close ListReady failure is best-effort — close succeeded, notification optional (D-13)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- bd is confirmed on PATH at ~/.local/bin/bd (blocker resolved in practice)
- Go 1.26.1 installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/go (satisfies go-sdk v1.4.1 requirement of Go 1.25+)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-21
Stopped at: Phase 2 Plan 01 complete — internal/graph package with 21 tests all passing. Ready for Phase 2 Plan 02 (gsdw ready subcommand).
Resume file: None
